## General

- Merge with main github.io repository? Possibly also use mr.kurzius.net as main address.

## Calc

- 4.2 and 4.3 is an overcomplicated mess. Find a way to streamline it and cut out what is not needed on the exam.
  - Look at other sources and see how they handle to opening to area and integrals.
- Antiderivative of $1/x$ not covered prior to 4.7? Maybe in 4.1 or 4.4?
- Deal with 4.6 #63 and the alternative example. When to know what $u$ to choose?

## Algebra 2

- In 4.4, address that complex fractions should be simplified so that only one rational expression exists in both the numerator and denominator before doing the final division.
- 5.5 and 5.6 have modified HW due to NJGPA
