## Rational and Irrational Numbers

We're going to start with talking about two different type of numbers: rational and irrational. Rational numbers are the ones you are used to seeing in math classes. It includes whole numbers, like $3$, fractions like $\frac{2}{5}$, and decimals like $0.7$. They also include repeating decimals, like $0.333\overline{3}$.

Those are all rational numbers because they be written as ratios, or fractions. $3$ is the same as $\frac{3}{1}$, $0.7$ is equal to $\frac{7}{10}$, and $0.333\overline{3}$ is just $\frac{1}{3}$.

Irrational numbers are strange numbers you likely haven't run into very often. They can't be written as fractions, so you might wonder how they can be written as well.
