## Variables

**Variables**â€”which are written using letters, like $x$â€”are used to represent an unknown quantity, or something that can change (or vary). Say you want to predict how much money you will make at your job. If you make $15 per hour, then you would multiply that by the number of hours you would work. You could write that as **expression**, using a variable to represent the hours. Expressions are just mathematical statements. They often include variables, but they don't need to.

So, our expression for predicting money made at work could be

$$ 15h $$

or

$$ 15x$$

or

$$15\cdot x$$

How you write it isn't as important as making sure other people can understand it.

## Evaluating Expressions

To evaluate your expression, you only need to substitute in a value and then calculate. So, if you worked 10 hours over the weekend, you can rewrite your expression with substitution. Make sure you use parentheses so you keep your numbers separate from each other.

$$15(10)\quad \text{or}\quad 15\cdot 10$$

## The Missing $\times$ Symbol

Unfortunately, writing multiplication with the times $(\times)$ symbol doesn't happen much at this level of math. This is mostly because it looks way too much like $x$, which is a common variable.

Also, it isn't on any standard keyboard. In fact, when using a computer, the star/asterisk `*` symbol is used for multiplication.

## ðŸ“– Reading Check

1. What purpose does a variable serve?
2. Come up with a situation where two things are being added together. Write an expression for it, and use at least one variable.
3. What should you put around a number when you substitute it into an expression?
4. Why don't we use the $\times$ symbol anymore?
