## ðŸ“– Lesson Questions

1. What word means to replace a variable with a value?
2. What operation is implied when two values are right next to each other?
3. How do you multiply fractions?
4. What do you think "evaluate" means?

Today's lesson is mostly a repeat of [the last lesson on variables](./1-2-introduction-to-variables.md), but with a few new things. Here's a quick recap: variables represent unknown values, or values that can vary. When you are given (or find) a value, you can substitute the value in for the variable. When you do, make sure to put parentheses around it so it doesn't look like part of another number.

## Evaluating expression with two variables

These will look more complicated, but if you remember to put parentheses around your substitutions, you'll be OK. Also, write out your work! Here's one example.

> Evaluate $10 + 2p - 3r$ when $p=4$ and $r=5$.
{: .example}

Keep in mind that when two value are right next to each other, that means you are meant to multiply them.

$$\begin{align}
10 + 2p - 3r \\
10 + 2(4) - 3(5) \\
10 + 8 - 15 \\
18 - 15 \\
3
\end{align}$$

$\blacksquare$

## Fractions and Decimals

Luckily, nothing changes once fractions and decimals are included. Don't forget to write everything down and use a calculator if you don't know a calculation.

> Evaluate $\frac{1}{3}a - 1 - \frac{1}{2}b$ when $a=12$ and $b=6$.
{: .example}

We have fractions and multiplication, so rewrite your whole numbers as fractions, then multiply across.

$$\begin{align}
\frac{1}{3}a - 1 - \frac{1}{2}b \\[0.5em]
\frac{1}{3}(12) - 1 - \frac{1}{2}(6) \\[0.5em]
\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{12}{1}\right) - 1 - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{6}{1}\right) \\[0.5em]
\frac{12}{3} - 1 - \frac{6}{2} \\[0.5em]
4 - 1 - 3 \\[0.5em]
-1
\end{align}$$

$\blacksquare$
{: .qed}
