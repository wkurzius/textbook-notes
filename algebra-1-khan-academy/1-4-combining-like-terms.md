## Terms and Expressions

**Terms** are anything that falls in between the addition and subtraction signs in an **expression**, a math statement with no equals sign.

The expression below has three terms: $3x$, $2y$, and $-5$.

$$ 3x + 2y - 5$$

Notice that we included the sign in front of the term, too. We normally don't write anything if it's positive, but the $5$ has a minus sign in front, so we include it when we list the terms.

## Like Terms

**Like terms** are terms that have the same variable. The expression above had three terms each with a different variable: $x$, $y$, and the last one did not have a variable. Terms without variables are called **constants** since there is no variable that will change its value.

Here's an expression with some like terms.

$$2x - 3y + 7x + 5y $$

The terms are $2x$, $-3y$, $7x$, and $5y$. Two of those terms have $x$ as a variable, so they can be added together. The two have $y$ as a variable, so they can be added together as well.

$$
2x - 3y + 7x + 5y \\
9x + 2y
$$

If you see a variable without a **coefficient**, or number in front, it's actual coefficient is $1$. Most of the time it's not written.

$$ (x - 6y + 5) + (-2x - 3) \\
x - 2x - 6y + 5 - 3 \\
-x - 6y + 2$$
