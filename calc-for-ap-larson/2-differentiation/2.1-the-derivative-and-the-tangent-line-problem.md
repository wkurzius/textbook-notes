title: 2.1 The Derivative and the Tangent Line Problem

## {{ page.title }}

What we did with limits, understanding what it means to approach something even if you can't get there, starts to pay off here. The fundamental problem that opens up the next chapter of mathematics is the tangent line problem. How can you determine the slope of the line that is tangent to a curve? This hurdle was collectively worked on so much that multiple people solved it at nearly the same exact time in different parts of the world. If you're curious about that history, this is a good place to start: [Leibnizâ€“Newton calculus controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%E2%80%93Newton_calculus_controversy)

As for the tangent line problem itself, you can approximate the tangent line with a secant line, just have the points really close to each other. We'll call that distance $\Delta x$ and use the slope formula to come up with something usable.
