### The Product Rule

When you have the product of two functions, like $x^2\sin x$, to find the derivative you need to follow the product rule.

$$ \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$$

The proof for this is straightforward enough that I encourage you to read through it in the book.

So, applying this to $x^2\sin x$ we get

$$\frac{d}{dx}[x^2\sin x] = 2x\sin x + x^2\cos x$$

In the case of more than two functions being multiplied, you can work your way down.

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)h(x)] &= f'(x)g(x)h(x) + f(x)\frac{d}{dx}[g(x)h(x)] \\
&= f'(x)g(x)h(x) + f(x)\left[g'(x)h(x)+g(x)h'(x)\right] \\
&= f'(x)g(x)h(x) + f(x)g'(x)h(x) + f(x)g(x)h'(x)
\end{align*}$$

The last line is the real takeaway. You'll have one term for each function, all while cycling through which function is differentiated.

For another example, let's try $(3x-2x^2)(5+4x)$.

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx}[(3x-2x^2)(5+4x)] &= (3 - 4x)(5+4x) + (3x-2x^2)(4) \\
&= (15 - 8x - 16x^2) + (12x - 8x^2) \\
&= -24x^2 + 4x + 15
\end{align*}$$
