With the Chain Rule, we can now tackle composite functions, like $(3x+2)^5$. To use it, you first need to identify what I'll call the outer and inner functions. You find the derivative of the outer function, while leaving the inner one alone, and multiply that by the derivative of the inner function.

Here it is in symbols.

$$ \frac{d}{dx}[f\left(g\left(x\right)\right)] =  $$
