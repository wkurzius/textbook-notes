## Rolle's Theorem

Rolle's theorem is another theorem that applies a rigorous definition to something that, at least in insight, is fairly simple.

> If a real-valued function $f$ is continuous on a proper closed interval $[a, b]$, differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$, and $f(a) = f(b)$, then there exists at least one $c$ in the open interval $(a, b)$ such that $f'( c ) = 0$.

Drawing a curve between two points with the same vertical means at some point that curve is flat.

## Mean value Theorem

Rolle's Theorem is really a jumping off point for the meat of the section, the Mean Value Theorem.
