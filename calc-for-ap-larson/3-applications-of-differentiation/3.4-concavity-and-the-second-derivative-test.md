## Concavity

Whether or not a graph curve upwards or downwards is measured by it's concavity. A slope that is increasing is concave upward, regardless of its negative or not, and likewise a decreasing slope is concave downward.

Well, just like we used $f'$ to quickly see when $f$ was increasing or decreasing, we can do the same with $f''$ to determine when $f'$ is increasing or decreasing, which will in turn let us know if $f$ is concave upward or downward.

## Points of Inflection

Where $f$ changes direction, from either increasing to decreasing or vice versa, $f'$ will show critical points.
