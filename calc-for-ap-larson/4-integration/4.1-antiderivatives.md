## Antiderivatives

We've dealt with derivatives for a while, but now we will start working backwards with antiderivatives. A function $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ when $F'(x) = f(x)$.

> Just to clear the air, there is no proper notation for an antiderivative. The most common way to note it is with the function's uppercase version. So, the antiderivative of $f(x)$ is $F(x)$.

Also, note that in our definition, it says "*an* antiderivative". There is never just one, because of constants. The derivative of both $x^2$ and $x^2 + 3$ is $2x$, and so both are antiderivatives of $2x$. Generally, we refer to that constant as $C$, so if you wanted to talk about *the* antiderivative of $2x$, it would be $x^2+C$.

## Solving a Differential Equation and the Integral Sign

The first example has you solve the differential equation $dy/dx = 2$, where a differential equation is any equation that involves derivatives. For now, solving differential equations involves finding the antiderivative. So in this case, our solution is $y = 2x + C$.

The notation you'll see going forward uses the integral sign. The $dx$ simply notes which variable is the target of our antidifferentiation.

$$ y = \int f(x) dx = Fx + C $$

For solving $dy/dx = 2$, we would do

$$ y = \int 2 dx = Fx + C $$
