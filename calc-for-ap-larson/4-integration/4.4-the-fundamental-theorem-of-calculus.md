Let's create a function, $A(x)$, that will produce the area under a curve, but $x$ will be the right bound of the interval. That function looks like this

$$ A(x) = \int_{0}^{x} f(x) \, dx $$

Now, what if we increased that area and wanted to find out how much it increased? This is represented by the red strip in the image. You start off with some set amount of area, say $A(5)$ (whatever that comes out to be), and we want to just slightly move to the right. That would make the new area $A(5+h)$. Since we're just interested in the change in area, the new area, we can just subtract what was there to begin with, so $A(x+h) - A(x)$.

We can also estimate that area as a rectangle. The width is $h$ and can use $f(x)$ as our height, because this is just an estimation. There is some amount of excess to account for, so we shouldn't forget about it.

$$ f(x) \cdot h + \text{Excess}$$

Well, that's two different ways of expressing the same rectangle. Both being equal we get

$$ f(x) \cdot h + \text{Excess} = A(x+h) - A(x) $$

Rearranging, and accounting for the fact we want $h$ to be as small as possible, we get

$$ f(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \left(\frac{A(x+h) - A(x)}{h} + \frac{\text{Excess}}{h}\right)$$

That excess term will go to zero as $h \to 0$, so we ultimately end up with

$$ f(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{A(x+h) - A(x)}{h} $$

Well, the right-hand side is literally the definition of a derivative.

$$ f(x) = A'(x) $$

Which leads to

$$ F(x) = A(x) $$

Or more plainly, the derivative on an integral is its function, and the antiderivative of a function is its integral.

## Evaluating Definite Integrals

You might have picked up on this relationship in 4.1 when we went over antidifferentiation, but now we can use this to find area under a curve. Keep in mind that $x$ was the upper bound of our interval in $A(x)$. Let's say we want the area defined by $\int_1^3 2x \, dx$. Well, $A(3)$ would give us the area up to 3, and $A(1)$ would give us the area up to 1. So, if we only want the area between 1 and 3, we can just subtract the two.

As seen above, integrals are just the antiderivative of the curve, so we need the antiderivative of $f$. Note that the constants cancel out because we can safely assume they are on the same curve.

$$ F(3) - F(1) = \left[(3)^2 + C\right] - \left[(1)^2 + C\right] = 8 $$

So, to evaluate any definite integral

$$ \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a) $$

## The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals

When we first started estimating area with rectangles, we saw that with one endpoint we had an overestimate, and the other endpoint gave us an underestimate. From that, we can assume that there must be some point in the middle that would give us a correct value.

So, given an interval $[a,b]$, there must exist some $c$ that would produce the exact height needed to accurately calculate the area.

$$ \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = f(c) \cdot (b-a) $$

This is the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals, which we can apply to finding the average value of a function.

$$ \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) \, dx $$

## The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Let's start out by evaluating a different type of definite integral.

$$ F(x) = \int_0^x \cos t \, dt $$

$x$ is now part of the interval, so we use $t$ as the variable of integration to avoid confusion. Despite the change, we can still do what we did before: find the antiderivative and then subtract.

$$ \int_0^x \cos t \, dt = \sin t \bigg\rvert_0^x = \sin x - 0 = \sin x $$

Now, if we found the derivative of $\sin x$, we'd end up with $\cos x$, which was our original $f(t)$.

$$ \frac{d}{dx} \left[ \int_0^x \cos t \, dt \right] = \frac{d}{dx} [\sin x] = \cos x $$

This is called the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and the general form of it is below.

$$ \frac{d}{dx} \left[ \int_a^x f(t) \, dt \right] = f(x) $$

Note that the interval begins at $a$, even though our example started at 0. It won't matter where the interval began, because it would evaluate to a number, which would disappear when the derivative was found.

Complications come in when the upper bound of our interval is no longer just $x$. This is where the chain rule comes back. Example 8 has the longer version, but chain rule dictates you keep the more complicated function, then multiply by its derivative at the end.

$$ \frac{d}{dx} \left[ \int_{\pi/2}^{x^3} \cos t \, dt \right] = \left( \cos x^3 \right) \left( 3x^2 \right ) $$
