## Log Rule for Integration

Despite the section's length, it doesn't cover anything too new. Instead, it combines the logarithm rule with integration by substitution.

$$\begin{align}
\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u| + C
\end{align}$$

There is also the alternative version which can be more helpful depending on the situation.

$$\begin{align}
\int \frac{u'}{u} \, dx= \ln|u| + C
\end{align}$$

There are a myriad of examples in the book, which aren't worth repeating here, so I won't.
