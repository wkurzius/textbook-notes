## Separation of Variables

We looked at this for the first time in [last section](./5.2-growth-and-decay.md), but we'll look at more varied examples here. In general, you can separate variables if it can be written in the form below.

$$\begin{align}
M(x) + N(y) \frac{dy}{dx} = 0
\end{align}$$

This form might not be immediately obvious, so some working out might be required.

### Example 1

> Find the general solution of $(x^2+4)\frac{dy}{dx} = xy$.
{. problem}

$$\begin{align}
(x^2+4)\frac{dy}{dx} &= xy \\
(x^2+4)\,dy &= xy\,dx \\
\frac{1}{y}\,dy &= \frac{x}{x^2+4}\,dx \\
\int \frac{1}{y}\,dy &= \int \frac{x}{x^2+4}\,dx \\
\ln |y| &= \frac{1}{2}\ln(x^2 + 4) + C \\
|y| &= e^C\sqrt{x^2+4} \cdot e^C \\
\end{align}$$

At this point, there are two things that need addressing. The first is the absolute value, which we can deal with by rewriting with $\pm$.

$$\begin{align}
y &= \pm e^C\sqrt{x^2+4} \\
\end{align}$$

Next is the fact that $e^C>0$, meaning we can't rewrite this is as $C$ ... at least not yet. The $\pm$ allows us to have negatives, so we are left with a $C$ that can be anything *but* zero.
