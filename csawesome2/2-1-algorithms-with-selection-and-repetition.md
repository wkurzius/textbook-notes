So far, you've been creating algorithms that involve sequencing, or steps that happen in order from first to last. This section is an introduction to the concepts of selection and repetition, where the order of execution isn't as straightforward. With selection, the value of a variable can determine which block of code executes next. With repetition, the same statements can occur multiple times, though they might work with different values each time.

The work in this section will get you comfortable with the idea of selection and repetition, and next section we'll work our way towards implementing selection in Java.
