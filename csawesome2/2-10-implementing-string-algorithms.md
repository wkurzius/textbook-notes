- Develop code for standard and original algorithms that involve strings and determine the result of these algorithms

## Assignment

- All **vocabulary**{: .apcsa-vocab}
- All [2.10 activities](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/manvillehighschool_csawesome2_2526/topic-2-10-strings-loops.html){: target="_blank"}

Much like last section, there are a few standard algorithms you need to be able to recreate.

- find if one or more substrings have a particular property
- determine the number of substrings that meet specific criteria
- create a new string with the characters reversed
