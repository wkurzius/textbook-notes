I'm just going to copy the essential knowledge from topic 3.2 in the AP Course Description. This is all important, but tough to apply directly to what you are doing now.

- *System reliability* refers to the program being able to perform its tasks as expected under stated conditions without failure. Programmers should make an effort to maximize system reliability by testing the program with a variety of conditions.

- The creation of programs has impacts on society, the economy, and culture. These impacts can be both beneficial and harmful. Programs meant to fill a need or solve a problem can have unintended harmful effects beyond their intended use.

- Legal issues and intellectual property concerns arise when creating programs. Programmers often reuse code written by others and published as open source and free to use. Incorporation of code that is not published as open source requires the programmer to obtain permission and often purchase the code before integrating it into their program.

We'll cover some AP questions that revolve around these ideas, but for now make sure your stuff works, doesn't move the world further into a dystopian hellscape, and isn't plagiarized.
