Mean is the sum of the data entries divided by the number of
entries. In statistics, variables are used to repesent the mean, but different ones depending on if we are talking about the mean of a population or sample.

$$ \text{Population: }\mu = \frac{\Sigma x}{N} \qquad \text{Sample: }\bar{x} = \frac{\Sigma x}{n} $$

An average is any single number or value that best represents a set of data. Most people have gone on to assume that average means taking the sum of everything and dividing by the number of items.
