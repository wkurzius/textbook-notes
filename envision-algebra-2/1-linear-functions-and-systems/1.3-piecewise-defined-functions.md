## 1.3 Piecewise-Defined Functions

A piecewise function is the combination of multiple functions, with each covering a different part of the overall function's domain.

$$f(x)=\begin{cases}
8x      && 0 \le x \le 40 \\
12x-160 && x > 40
\end{cases}$$

The domain of the entire function is $[0,\infty)$, but from $[0,40]$ it follows the function $8x$. Beyond that it takes on $12x-60$.

There is not much to these besides understanding how to read them. They are just two (or more) functions graphed together.
