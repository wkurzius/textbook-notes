title: 1.7 Solving Linear Systems Using Matrices
---

## {{ page.title }}

We've already seen matrices and have gone over how to solve linear systems, so most of this section will be extra practice. The only catch it that we'll do it all with matrices.

### Matrix Row Operations

Last section we went over operations on linear systems, and these carry over to matrices as well, with one addition: row switching. This does exactly what you think it does.

$$
    \left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
    a & b & c \\
    d & e & f
    \end{array}\right]

    \Rightarrow

    \left[\begin{array}{cc|c}
    d & e & f \\
    a & b & c
    \end{array}\right]

$$
