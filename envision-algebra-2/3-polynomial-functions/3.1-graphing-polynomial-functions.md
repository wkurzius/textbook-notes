Polynomials are expressions that involve addition, subtraction, multiplication and exponentiation to nonnegative integer powers. You've seen polynomials already with linear and quadratic functions, but this chapter will look at polynomials in general, rather than specific ones.

### Classifying Polynomials

First thing is to lay the ground work for how we describe polynomials. First up is the **standard form of a polynomial**, which is when the polynomial is written so that each term is in descending order of degree, or exponent.

$$ -4x + 9 + 2x^3 \quad \rightarrow \quad 2x^3 - 4x + 9 $$

We'll typically deal with one variable, but in case of multiples the degree is the sum of the exponents.

The **degree of a polynomial** is just the greatest degree in the polynomial. In the one above, the degree is 3.
