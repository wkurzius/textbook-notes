## Identify Possible Rational Solutions

By now, you've likely run into a polynomial that you couldn't factor, for example $2x^{3}-6x^{2}-x+5$. Short of turning to technology to either graph it or find the zeros directly, there is one more path: the rational root theorem.

If the polynomial has a rational root (so this doesn't cover irrational or complex roots), that root can be written as $x= p/q$, where

- $p$ is an integer factor of the constant term, and
- $q$ is an integer factor of the leading coefficient.

If you look back at any of the polynomials you've factored, you'll find they all fit. Any rational zero can be written as the quotient of $p$ and $q$, factors of the constant and leading coefficient.

We can use this knowledge to come up with a list of *potential* roots for a polynomial, like $2x^{3}-6x^{2}-x+5$. If this has a rational root, something we can factor out, it will be in the form $p/q$. To find the candidates, we need the factors of our constant and leading coefficient. And don't forget about the negatives.

For $p$, we have $\pm5$ and $\pm1$. For $q$, $\pm2$ and $\pm1$. That means our list of potential rational zeros is

$$ \pm\frac{5}{2}, \pm5, \pm\frac{1}{2}, \pm1$$

That is eight candidates
