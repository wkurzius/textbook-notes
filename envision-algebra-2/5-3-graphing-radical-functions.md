## Transforming Radical Functions

See [section 1.2](./1.2-transformation-of-functions.md). Seriously. There is nothing new here. Just keep in mind that radicals with odd indices, like cube root, can have negative numbers in their domain. Square roots are restricted to non-negative numbers.

## Rewrite a Radial Function

Simplifying a radical functions can make spotting transformation easier.

$$\begin{align}
f(x) &= \sqrt{4x+16} + 7 \\
     &= \sqrt{4(x + 4)} + 7 \\
f(x) &= 2\sqrt{x+4} + 7
\end{align}$$

It's usually a good idea to factor so that $x$ has a coefficient of $1$. Horizontal scale can move key points, like vertices, making it difficult to see horizontal translations. In the original function above, the function was moved left $16$, but then scaled horizontally by $4$, meaning it ended up only being moved $4$ units to the left. It's easier to spot this in the factored version.

The two functions above are identical, blurring the lines between horizontal and vertical scaling.

$$\begin{align}
f(x) &= \sqrt{9x} \\
g(x) &= 3\sqrt{x}
\end{align}$$

Vertical is typically the easier of the two to process, so rewriting in that form is desired.
