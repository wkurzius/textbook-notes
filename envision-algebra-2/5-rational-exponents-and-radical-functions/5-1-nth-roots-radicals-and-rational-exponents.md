## The $n$th Root

The majority of the chapter deals with exponents and roots, so we'll start with looking at roots beyond the square root.

> ### The $n$th Root of a Number
>
> The $n$th root of a number $c$ is any $x$ such that $x^n=c$. It can be denoted by
> $$\begin{align}
> \sqrt[n]c
> \end{align}$$
> where $n$ is the index and $c$ is the radicand.

Often, finding a particular root of a number comes down to either knowing it or using a calculator. How they are calculated is beyond what the scope of this course.

There are, however, a few ways to arrive at an answer if you know your factoring rules. For example, finding $\sqrt[4]{16}$ using difference of squares.

$$\begin{align}
x^4 &= 16 \\
x^4 - 16 &= 0  \\
(x^2 - 4)(x^2+4) &= 0 \\
(x-2)(x+2)(x^2+4) &= 0 \\[0.5em]
x&=\pm2
\end{align}$$
