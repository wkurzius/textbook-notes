## Trigonometric Ratios

You might remember that similar triangles, or any polygon for that matter, have side lengths that are in proportion to each other. So, if ${\triangle ABC \sim \triangle XYZ}$, then ...

$$\begin{align}
\frac{\overline{AB}}{\overline{XY}} = \frac{\overline{BC}}{\overline{YZ}}
\end{align}$$

With some algebra, we can rearrange that proportion.

$$\begin{align}
\frac{\overline{AB}}{\overline{BC}} = \frac{\overline{XY}}{\overline{YZ}}
\end{align}$$

This means that the ratios between the sides are equal to each other, as long as the triangles themselves are similar. This relationship between the sides of a triangle are codified with trigonometric ratios and right triangles.

> Right triangles are used because they are, in a sense, the basic building block of geometry. The fact that two of its sides are perpendicular, or orthogonal, to each other, gives them almost universal application.

So, given a right triangle, from the perspective of one of the angles $\theta$ that is *not* the right angle, we can start by defining the three basic trigonometric functions.

$$\begin{align}
\sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \qquad
\cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \qquad
\tan \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
\end{align}$$

Where these names come from won't make much sense at the moment, but to help you remember them there is the acronym **SohCahToa**
