## Sine and Cosine in Other Quadrants

Last section we redefined sine and cosine on the coordinate plane. While the idea behind opposite adjacent sides still hold true, we also know that for any point on the unit circle ...

$$\begin{align}
(x, y) = (\cos\theta, \sin\theta)
\end{align}$$

Well, what if the terminal side went into another quadrant, and we had angles that were no longer just acute? With triangles, sine and cosine were just the ratios of two sides of the triangle. Now that we are in the coordinate plane, we've reframed that ratio as distance from the origin, or your $x$ and $y$ coordinates.
