## Translating Trig Functions

Like with shifting functions before, adding on to the entire function is a vertical shift, while subtracting to the $x$ moves it horizontally. Also, remember that the horizontal shift is opposite what you would expect. Subtracting moves it right, while adding moves it left.

With trig functions, horizontal translations are called **phase shifts**. Vertical shifts determine where the midline will end up.

If it's not written in that form, I advise you rewrite it to make your life easier. So, with $y = \cos(2x + \frac{\pi}{4})$ your phase shift is *not* $\frac{\pi}{4}$. Factor out the $2$ so $x$ has a coefficient of $1$ and you'll get the form above.

$$\begin{align}
y = \cos2(x + \frac{\pi}{8})
\end{align}$$

Now it's a lot easier to see the phase shift, which is $\frac{\pi}{8}$.
