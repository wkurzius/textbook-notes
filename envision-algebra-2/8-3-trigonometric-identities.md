This is the last section. It's a lot of memorization that I don't expect you to memorize. There are some exceptions to this, ones that you should absolutely know, but I will note them below. Usually they are simpler, if not also intuitive.

And since these are all formulas and equations, I'm going to pass on writing out proofs. They are available in the book to read.

## Trig Identities to Know

> \tan\theta =\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}

> ### Pythagorean Identity

> $$\begin{align}
> \sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1
> \end{align}$$

Spend some time thinking about that one. Specifically, look at a unit circle and draw a right triangle in there somewhere.

> ### Odd-Even Identities
>
> $$\begin{align}
> \sin(-x) &= -\sin x \\
> \cos(-x) &= \cos x \\
> \tan(-x) &= -\tan x
> \end{align}$$

We went over odd and even functions way back in [section 3.7](./3.7-transformations-of-polynomial-functions.md), so this is really a refresher of those rules. Sine and tangent are odd functions, so symmetrical about the origin. Cosine is even since it's symmetrical across the $y$-axis.

## Trig Identities that Exist

You should be aware of the following identities, as in "I wonder if there's a trig identity that will help this problem, so let's look them up". I won't make you memorize them for this class, and I can attest to them being absent on the AP Calc AB exam, as can these random people on reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/apcalculus/comments/u48bmp/what_are_the_most_important_trig_identities_to/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/APStudents/comments/ru3chu/what_trig_identities_do_i_need_for_the_calculus/).

> ### Cofunction Identities
>
> $$\begin{align}
> \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - x \right) &= \cos x \\
> \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - x \right) &= \sin x \\
> \tan \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - x \right) &= \cot x \\
> \end{align}$$
{: .definition}

> ### Sum Formulas
>
> $$\begin{align}
> \sin ( \alpha + \beta) &= \sin\alpha\cos\beta +\cos\alpha\sin\beta \\
> \cos ( \alpha + \beta) &= \cos\alpha\cos\beta +\sin\alpha\sin\beta \\
> \end{align}$$
