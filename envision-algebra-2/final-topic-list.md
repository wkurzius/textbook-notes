Along with that, you should know the general features of the graphs of each function type we've covered. Think domain, range, intercepts, asymptotes, positive/negative and increasing/decreasing intervals. You should also know how transformations work.

This info is spread throughout the book, so here's another list. I am not pulling a question from each section listed. More likely, it will be just two or three questions about graphs and transformations, but I am not telling you ahead of time which functions I'm choosing.

1. [1-1 Key Features of Functions](./1.1-key-features-of-functions.md)
2. [1-2 Transformation of Functions](./1.2-transformation-of-functions.md)
3. [3-1 Graphing Polynomial Functions](./3.1-graphing-polynomial-functions.md)
4. [3-7 Transformations of Polynomial Functions](./3.7-transformations-of-polynomial-functions.md)
5. [4-1 ~~Inverse Variation and~~ the Reciprocal Function](./4.1-inverse-variation-and-the-reciprocal-function.md)
6. [4-2 Graphing Rational Functions](./4.2-graphing-rational-functions.md)
7. [5-3 Graphing Radical Functions](./5-3-graphing-radical-functions.md)
8. [6-1 Key Features of Exponential Functions](./6-1-key-features-of-exponential-functions.md)
