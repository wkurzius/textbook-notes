title: Final Exam Topic List

This topics below are where I could pull questions from the final. To save you some time, here's [a PDF with all the Topic Reviews](./pdf/aga_a2_1-8_tr.pdf).

Also, you get a cheat sheet and there is no calculator.

Along with that, you should know the general features of the graphs of each function type we've covered. Think domain, range, intercepts, asymptotes, positive/negative and increasing/decreasing intervals. You should also know how transformations work.

This info is spread throughout the book, so here's another list. I am not pulling a question from each section listed. More likely, it will be just two or three questions about graphs and transformations, but I am not telling you ahead of time which functions I'm choosing.

- [1-1 Key Features of Functions](./1.1-key-features-of-functions.md)
- [1-2 Transformation of Functions](./1.2-transformation-of-functions.md)
- [3-1 Graphing Polynomial Functions](./3.1-graphing-polynomial-functions.md)
- [3-7 Transformations of Polynomial Functions](./3.7-transformations-of-polynomial-functions.md)
- [4-1 ~~Inverse Variation and~~ the Reciprocal Function](./4.1-inverse-variation-and-the-reciprocal-function.md)
- [4-2 Graphing Rational Functions](./4.2-graphing-rational-functions.md)
- [5-3 Graphing Radical Functions](./5-3-graphing-radical-functions.md)
