For your fourth project, you'll build a landing page for a product, again while satisfying user stories. Here's [freeCodeCamp's example](https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks/){: target="_blank"} and [my own version](https://wkurzius.github.io/landing-page/){: target="_blank"}.

Like the other projects, you will

1. Work towards passing all the tests, which are based on the listed User Stories
2. Style your page using CSS
3. Publish your project
4. Submit the URL to your published project

## Content

The content is up to you, but encourage you to be creative. Use lorem ipsum where appropriate.

## Style

Design your landing page however you want, but some style should be applied to most elements.

## Everything Else

Make sure you read this page at least once: [Certification Project General Information](./general-guidelines.md). The information in there applies to each project, not just this one.
