For your first project, you'll build a survey form while satisfying user stories (requirements). For a few examples, here's [one from freeCodeCamp](https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks/){: target="_blank"} and [my own version](https://wkurzius.github.io/survey-form/){: target="_blank"}.

More details below, but in short you will

1. Work towards passing all the tests, which are based on the listed User Stories
2. Style your page using CSS
3. Publish your project
4. Submit the URL to your published project

## Content

The questions in your survey are completely up to you. As long as you satisfy the user stories, which do request certain types of questions, they can be whatever you want.

## Style

You can also design your survey however you want, but you must apply some design to it. See the rubric below for more details, but some style should be applied to most elements.

## Everything Else

Make sure you read this page at least once: [Certification Project General Information](./general-guidelines.md). The information in there applies to each project, not just this one.
