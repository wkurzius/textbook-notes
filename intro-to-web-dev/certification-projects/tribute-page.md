For your second project, you'll build a tribute page that focuses on the life of an individual, again while satisfying user stories. Here's [freeCodeCamp's example](https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks/){: target="_blank"} and [my own](https://wkurzius.github.io/tribute/){: target="_blank"}.

Like the other projects, you will

1. Work towards passing all the tests, which are based on the listed User Stories
2. Style your page using CSS
3. Publish your project
4. Submit the URL to your published project

## Content

Pick a person to be the subject of your webpage and include a significant amount of information about them. If you're following the timeline format from the examples, you should include at least ten items.

## Style

Like before, you can design your tribute page however you want, but some style should be applied to most elements.

## Everything Else

Make sure you read this page at least once: [Certification Project General Guidelines](./general-guidelines.md). The information in there applies to each project, not just this one.
