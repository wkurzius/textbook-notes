For your final project, you'll build a portfolio page highlighting your development work. Here's [freeCodeCamp's example](https://personal-portfolio.freecodecamp.rocks/){: target="_blank"} and [my own version](https://wkurzius.github.io/portfolio/){: target="_blank"}.

**_This project cannot be done—and won't be accepted—until the other four projects are complete._**

Like the other projects, you will

1. Work towards passing all the tests, which are based on the listed User Stories
2. Style your page using CSS
3. Publish your project
4. Submit the URL to your published project

## Content

The content is all about you and your projects. You can think of this is a online resume.

## Style

Creativity is a must. Do something different and go outside your comfort zone.

## Everything Else

Make sure you read this page at least once: [Certification Project General Information](./general-guidelines.md). The information in there applies to each project, not just this one.
