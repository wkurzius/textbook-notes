## Solving equations with one unknown

When dealing with equations, meaning there is an equal sign joining two expressions, we are working under the assumption that it is a true statement. Anything we do to the equation has to maintain that property of the equation being true. If you choose to add 5 five to one side of the equation, you need to make sure that you do so one the other side as well.

Combining like terms and simplifying does not change the value of an expression, so you don't need to worry about mirroring what you are doing. Simplifying both sides is probably a good idea anyway, but just keep in mind that you are not actually changing the value.

$$\begin{align*}
-9 - (9x - 6) &= 3(4x + 6) \\
  -9 - 9x + 6 &= 12x + 18 && \text{Simplifying with distribution} \\
      -9x - 3 &= 12x + 18 && \text{Simplifying by combining like terms} \\
     -9x - 21 &= 12x      && \text{Subtract $18$ from both sides} \\
          -21 &= 21x      && \text{Add $9x$ to both sides} \\
           -1 &= x        && \text{Divide both sides by 21}
\end{align*}$$

### Number of solutions to equations

Equations are used to model situations and knowing how many solutions to expect from an equation can be helpful. With a single equation with only one variable, we can typically expect to have one solution. You can find a way to solve it so that you get $x=a$, where $a$ is some value.

There are two other possibilities. One is where instead of ending up with $x=a$, you get $a=a$.

$$\begin{align*}
-7x + 2 &= 2x + 2 - 9x                                  \\
-7x + 2 &= -7x + 2      && \text{Combine like terms}    \\
      2 &= 2            && \text{Add $7x$ to both sides}
\end{align*}$$

We hit a point were we have an obviously true statement, $2=2$. Both sides of the equation were actually the same expression, so the value of $x$ doesn't matter. Every value would work, meaning we have an infinite number of solutions.

Here's a slightly different version of that equation.

$$\begin{align*}
-7x + 3 &= 2x + 2 - 9x                                  \\
-7x + 3 &= -7x + 2      && \text{Combine like terms}    \\
      3 &= 2            && \text{Add $7x$ to both sides}
\end{align*}$$

Now we have an obviously false statement with $3=2$. Again, it doesn't really matter what value we plug in for $x$, the statement will always be false, meaning we have no solutions.

## Solutions to linear equations

A linear equation is an equation which can be written in the form $ax + by + c = 0$. Some examples are below.

$$
x + y + 3 = 0 \\[0.25em]
-2x - 10y + 2 = 0 \\[0.25em]
y = 8x + 5 \\[0.25em]
9x = 4y \\[0.25em]
3y = 10 \\[0.25em]
\frac{2}{3} = x
$$

Note that the last two only have one variable; one of the coefficients is just 0. The equation $3y=10$ can be written as $0x + 3y - 10 = 0$.

The last two examples you have worked with before. They will typically have one solution (remember that infinite and none are possibilities, too). The others have two variables, and they have an infinite number of solutions, but those solutions come in pairs.

$$ y = 3x + 2 $$

For example, some of the solutions to the equation above are $(0,2)$, $(1,5)$, and $(10,32)$. If you were to take all those solutions and graph them on a coordinate plane, they would form a straight line.
