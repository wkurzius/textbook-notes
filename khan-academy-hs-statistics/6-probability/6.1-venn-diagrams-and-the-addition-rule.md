title: Venn diagrams and the addition rule
---

If you picture a single coin, it has two sides, one typically called heads and the other tails. Flipping the coin in the air and letting it land at random means one of those two sides will be face up. The probability of one side or the other being face up is 50%. Two sides, even chances of either one being the winner.

The other way to think about that coin is with a ratio. The number of desirable outcomes (the one you are looking for) compared to the total possible outcomes. With the coin its a ratio of $1/2$, which conveniently is 50%.

With the ratio idea in mind, we can extend that to other situations that aren't as clear cut as a coin flip. Rolling a 2 on a standard 6-sided die would be $1/6$ or about 16.7%. The probability of pulling a king from a deck of cards would be $4/52$ or about 7.6%.

The trick with basic probability is determining those two numbers: your desirable outcomes and your total outcomes.

## Venn Diagrams and Probability

Here is a Venn diagram of 80 wedding guests and whether they were a friend of the bride or the groom.

If we picked a guest at random, what's the probability that they were a friend of the bride? Remember that we need two numbers: the desired outcome and the total possible outcomes.

The total possible outcomes is straightforward since we have 80 people to choose from. The desired outcomes requires a little more work since their is some overlap between the two groups. While we have 17 that are friends with the bride, there are also another 42 that are friends with both. They count too, so the total number of bride's friends is $17+42=59$. That means the probability that a guest picked at random was a friend of the bride is $59/80$ or about 74%.

## Two-way Tables and Probability

Here is a two-way table for commencement seating.

These are different from Venn diagrams since we have overlapping variables rather than overlapping categories. A student can't be both a junior and senior at the same time, but they could be a junior and in choir. Or not in choir. Or any other combination of the two variables.

So, what's the probability of picking a student at random and them being in choir? Simple enough. There are 41 students in the choir and 480 people total. So, $41/480$ is about 8.5%.

What if we wanted someone in choir or a senior? We still have 41 in choir, and we also have 459 seniors. That gives a grand total of $41+459=500$. But that doesn't make any sense. There are only 480 people. What happened was that our group of seniors in the choir was counted twice. Looking at just the totals is misleading since you will have people that exist in both categories.

The best approach is the instead look at the internal parts of the table and ignore the totals. Find the groups that matter and total them up instead.

In this case, the groups that satisfy our conditions of either in the choir or a senior are $15+23+3+436=477$.

## Notation

In formal notation, what we did above looks like this.

$$ P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)$$

And sometimes it's written as

$$ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$

The 'or' and the cup symbol are synonymous with the word 'union'. We want to know the probability of any of those events happening, so we total them up.
