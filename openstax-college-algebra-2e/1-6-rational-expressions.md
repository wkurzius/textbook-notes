## Simplifying Rational Expressions

A rational expressions is the quotient of two polynomials.

$$\begin{align}
\frac{x^2+8x+16}{x^2+11x+28}
\end{align}$$

We'll be working with these in this section, but the underlying mechanic in all of these problems is simplifying them. In most cases, this will make them easier to work with. And the key to simplifying them is to factor each polynomial. So, here is the one above fully factored.

$$\begin{align}
\frac{(x+4)^2}{(x+7)(x+4)}
\end{align}$$

With the rational expression factored, we can look for common factors between the numerator and denominator. They have an $(x+4)^2$ in common, so we can divide those to be $1$ and rewrite the expression.

$$\begin{align}
\frac{(x+4)^2}{(x+7)(x+4)} = \frac{x+4}{x+7}
\end{align}$$

## Multiplying Rational Expressions

$$\begin{align}
\frac{x^2+4x-5}{3x+18}\cdot\frac{2x-1}{x+5}
\end{align}$$

The rules for multiplying fractions still apply here: just multiply straight across. But our goal is still to simplify these expressions, so its best to factor first.

$$\begin{align}
\frac{x^2+4x-5}{3x+18}\cdot\frac{2x-1}{x+5} = \frac{(x+5)(x-1)}{3(x+6)}\cdot\frac{2x-1}{x+5}
\end{align}$$

Now we can look for common factors just like before and combine the two.

$$\begin{align}
\frac{(x+5)(x-1)}{3(x+6)}\cdot\frac{2x-1}{x+5} &= \frac{(x-1)(2x-1)}{3(x+5)}
\end{align}$$

And that's it. There is no need to distribute and expand those binomials at this point. Certain problems may require that, but here we just want to simplify so this form is perfectly acceptable.

## Dividing Rational Expressions

Dividing is the same multiplying by the reciprocal of a number.

$$\begin{align}
2\div3 = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}
\end{align}$$

So, when you run into division with rational expressions, but just flip the second one and multiply like normal.

$$\begin{align}
\frac{1}{x}\div\frac{x^2}{3} = \frac{1}{x}\cdot\frac{3}{x^2} = \frac{3}{x^3}
\end{align}$$
