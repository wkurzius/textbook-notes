> ## How to Use this Book
>
> Reading each section is strongly recommended, along with taking notes. A good place to start is defining any **bolded vocabulary** and copying any asides that sum up information. The first one of those you will run into is called "Sets of Numbers".
>
> You should also work through the examples, only looking at the solution steps if you are unsure of the next step. The "Try It" problems are there for you to test if you understood the examples, and the answers for them are found at the end of the book, along with answers to the odd exercises.

## Classifying a Real Number

**Natural numbers** are your counting numbers, so $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$ **Whole numbers** include 0 so we end up with $\{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots \}$. It a minor distinction and it doesn't come up much, but if it does we'll be sure to be extra clear if zero is included or not.

**Integers** are the whole numbers and their opposites, so $\{\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 , \dots\}$. Integers tend to be talked about as positive or negative, but keep in mind that zero is neither positive or negative.

**Rational numbers** are any number that can be written as the quotient of any two integers, with the one exception being that you can't divide by 0.

$$\left\{\frac{m}{n}∣m\text{ and } n \text{ are integers and } n\neq 0\right\}$$

Any integer can be written as a rational number by putting it over 1.

Rational numbers also have the property, that when written in decimal form, either terminate or have a repeating pattern. So, $4.2$ is the rational number $\frac{21}{5}$ and $3.\overline{23}$ is the number $\frac{320}{99}$.

### Irrational Numbers

**Irrational numbers** are all the numbers that don't fit the above definitions, so they cannot be expressed as a fraction. And when written as a decimal they don't terminate and also don't repeat. We don't deal with them too often because of their strange behavior, but common ones are $\pi$ and $\sqrt{2}$.

### Real Numbers

Together, the rational and irrational numbers make up the set of **real numbers**. Each real number can be placed in a unique spot on the real number line, and conversely each spot on the number line corresponds to a unique real number.

The rational numbers is a larger set including integers, which in turn includes whole numbers, which include the natural numbers. You can see those relationship below with $N$ being the natural numbers, $W$ whole, $I$ integer, $Q$ the rationals, and $Q'$ the irrational numbers.
