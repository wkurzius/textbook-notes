## Classifying a Real Number

**Natural numbers** are your counting numbers, so $\{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$ **Whole numbers** include 0 so we end up with $\{0, 1, 2, 3, \dots \}$. It a minor distinction and it doesn't come up much, but if it does we'll be sure to be extra clear if zero is included or not.

**Integers** are the whole numbers and their opposites, so $\{\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 , \dots\}$. Integers tend to be talked about as positive or negative, but keep in mind that zero is neither positive or negative.

**Rational numbers** is any number that can be written as the quotient of any two integers. $\{\frac{m}{n}∣\text{$m$ and $n$ are integers and $n\neq0$}\}$.
