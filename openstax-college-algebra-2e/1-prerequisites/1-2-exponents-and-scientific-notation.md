## Exponent Rules

### The Product Rule

An exponent just means repeated multiplication, so $x^3 = x \cdot x \cdot x$. That means if we have a expression like $x^3 \cdot x^2$, then it would be the same thing as $(x \cdot x \cdot x)\cdot(x \cdot x)=x^5$.

The product rule of exponents formalizes this as

$$\begin{align}
a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m + n}
\end{align}$$

### The Quotient Rule

The quotient rule, maybe predictably, subtracts your exponents rather than add them. If you had the expression $\frac{x^3}{x^2}$, that would be equivalent to $\frac{x \cdot x \cdot x}{x \cdot x}$. Common factors in the numerator and denominator reduce to 1, meaning two $x$ factors can be removed from both, leaving us with just $x$. So, $\frac{x^3}{x^2}=x$.

$$\begin{align}
\frac{a^m}{a^n}=a^{m-n}
\end{align}$$

### The Power Rule

Raising an exponent to a power would look like this.

$$\begin{align}
(x^2)^3 = (x \cdot x)\, (x \cdot x)\, (x \cdot x) = x^6
\end{align}$$

Meaning our power rule is

$$\begin{align}
(a^m)^n = a^{mn}
\end{align}$$
