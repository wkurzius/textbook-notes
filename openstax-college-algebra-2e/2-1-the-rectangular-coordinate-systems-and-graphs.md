## Plotting Ordered Pairs in the Cartesian Coordinate System

Cartesian Coordinate System is the fancy name for this:

![Cartesian coordinate system](./img/2-1-ccs.jpg)

It consists of an **$x$-axis** (horizontal) and a **$y$-axis** (vertical), and the point where they meet is the **origin**. The four areas that are created by the intersecting axes are **quadrants** and are numbered I through IV starting with the top-right and moving counter-clockwise.

An **ordered pair** is used to identify the location of a point on the plane, for example $(3,-1)$. The first number is the **$x$-coordinate** and the second is the **$y$-coordinate**. Starting from the origin, you use these numbers to locate your point. In this case, you move along the $x$-axis $3$ in and the $y$-axis $-1$.
