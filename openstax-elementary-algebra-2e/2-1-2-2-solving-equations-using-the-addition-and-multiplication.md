## Verify a Solution of an Equation

Equations are mathematical statements, specifically they are considered *true* statements. This means if part of the equation is unknown (represented by a variable), the goal is typically to find a **solution**, or a value that ensures the equation remains true.

To see if a solution works, you substitute it into the equation. Let's check if $x=\frac{3}{2}$ is a solution to the equation ${4x-2=2x+1}$.

$$\begin{align}
4x - 2 &= 2x + 1 \\
4\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) - 2 &= 2\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) + 1 \\
6 - 2 &= 3 + 1 \\
4 &= 4
\end{align}$$

Notice that when substituting I used parentheses. Handwriting can be misread, so this helps to avoid any confusion about what operation is taking place.

# Solve Equations Using the Addition/Subtraction Property of Equality

In equations, variables can represent an unknown quantity. So, ${x+3=8}$ means that some number increased by $3$ is equal to $8$. You might be able to determine $x$ without much work, but let's use subtraction property of equality.

> For any numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$,
> $$\begin{align}
> &\text{If}   & a  &= b \\
> &\text{then} & a-c&=b-c
> \end{align}$$

If you subtract one quantity from one side, then you can do to the same to the other and the equation will remain true. So, with our equation we can subtract $3$ from both sides to determine the value of $x$, the solution to the equation.

$$\begin{align}
x + 3 &= 8 \\
x + 3 - 3 &= 8 - 3 \\
x &= 5
\end{align}$$

And this works with addition as well, since addition and subtraction are essentially the same operation.
