## Solve Equations Using the General Strategy

We now have everything we need solve linear equations and can form a list of steps to follow.

> ### General strategy for solving linear equations.
>
> 1. **Simplify** Use the Distributive Property to remove any parentheses and combine like terms on both sides of the equation.
> 2. **Collect** Use the Addition and Subtraction Properties of Equality to collect all the variable terms on one side, and constants on the other.
> 4. **Solve** Make the coefficient of the variable term to equal to 1 by using the Multiplication or Division Property of Equality.
> 5. **Check** Substitute the solution into the original equation to make sure the result is a true statement.

$$\begin{align}
5(x - 3) - 5 &= -10 \\
(5x - 15) - 5 &= -10 && \text{Simplify} \\
5x - 20 &= -10 && \text{Simplify again} \\
5x - 20 + 20 &= -10 + 20 && \text{Collect the constants} \\
5x &= 10 \\
x &= 2 &&\text{Solve} \\[1em]
5\left((2) - 3\right) - 5 &= -10 \\
5(-1) - 5 &= -10 \\
-10 &= -10 &&\text{Check}
\end{align}$$

## Classify Equations

Every equation we have looked at so far is considered a **conditional** equation. They are true statements if you place the correct value (or values) in for the variables. If you place the incorrect value, then the equation is false.

The equation ${x+3=6}$ is a conditional equation because it's only true when $x=3$. Any other value results in a false statement.

An **identity** is always true, no matter what the value used for the variable. The simplest version of an identity is $x=x$, but they can be appear in other forms.

$$\begin{align}
2x + 6 &= 2(x + 3) \label{ident}\\
2x + 6 &= 2x + 6
\end{align}$$

We can continue to follow our strategy, since both sides are exactly the same we can conclude that equation $\ref{ident}$ is an identity.

The last type of equation we'll look at is a **contradiction**. These are false no matter what, for examples ${x = x + 1}$. Like identities, these can be hidden until a few steps into your solving strategy.
