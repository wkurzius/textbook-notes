## Graph Inequalities on the Number Line

An equation is a statement that claims two things are equal. An **inequality** does the opposite and is statement about two things not being equal to each other.

$$\begin{align}
x+3 &> 5
\end{align}$$

Fortunately, finding the solution to an inequality is exactly the same as finding the solution to an equation, except for one big exception.

$$\begin{align}
-x < -10
\end{align}$$

In the above statement, you'd naturally want to multiply/divide by $-1$, resulting in a new statement of ${x<10}$. But when we go back to check, with say $5$

$$\begin{align}
-x < -10 \\
-(5) < -10
\end{align}$$

it fails. Whn you multiply or divide by a negative number, you also have to flip the inequality symbol as well.

Why this happens is a little clearer when you think of operations as transformations. If you picture the number $10$ on a number line and add $3$, the point has moved $3$ units to the right. If you instead started at $20$ and added $3$, you would still be moved $3$ to the left. Addition and subtraction are shift a number.

Now take $10$ and multiply it by $2$. The result is moving $10$ units up the number line. If you did the same thing with $20$, you'd move $20$ units. Unlike with addition or subtraction, the starting point matters because multiplication and division are scaler operations. Their effect scales based on what you started with.
