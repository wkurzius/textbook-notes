## Translate and Solve Basic Percent Equations

Remember that to find part of something, you use multiplication. Half of a number is $\frac{1}{2}x$, twice something is $2x$, and 35% of something is $0.35x$. And since percentages are a way of describing part of a whole, we can set up a simple formula.

$$\begin{align}
\text{Part} = \text{Percent}\cdot\text{Whole}
\end{align}$$

The only catch is remembering to convert percentages to decimals when doing the math.
