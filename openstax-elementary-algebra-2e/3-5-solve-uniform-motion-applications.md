## Solve Uniform Motion Applications

Problems in this section revolve around the formula involving distance, speed (rate), and time.

$$\begin{align}
D = rt
\end{align}$$

### Example 1

> An express train and a local train leave Pittsburgh to travel to Washington, D.C. The express train can make the trip in 4 hours and the local train takes 5 hours for the trip. The speed of the express train is 12 miles per hour faster than the speed of the local train. Find the speed of both trains.
{: .example}

Organization will be your best friend with problems like these. Try making a table and filling in information from the problem. Here are four pieces, but make sure you can trace where each comes from in the problem.

|         | Rate (mph) | Time (hr) | Distance (mi) |
| ------- | :--------: | :-------: | :-----------: |
| Express |   $r+12$   |    $4$    |               |
| Local   |    $r$     |    $5$    |               |

Using our formula for distance, we can fill in the last column.

|         | Rate (mph) | Time (hr) | Distance (mi) |
| ------- | :--------: | :-------: | :-----------: |
| Express |   $r+12$   |    $4$    |   $4(r+12)$   |
| Local   |    $r$     |    $5$    |     $5r$      |

Both trains are making the same trip, so the distances will be equal. We can use that fact to create an equation to solve

$$\begin{align}
4(r+12) &= 5r \\
4r + 48 &= 5r \\
48 &= 4 \\
\end{align}$$

The local train travels at $48$ mph, while the express at $12$ mph faster, travels at a rate of $60$ mph.

### Example 2

> Christopher and his parents live 115 miles apart. They met at a restaurant between their homes to celebrate his mother’s birthday. Christopher drove 1.5 hours while his parents drove 1 hour to get to the restaurant. Christopher’s average speed was 10 miles per hour faster than his parents’ average speed. What were the average speeds of Christopher and of his parents as they drove to the restaurant?
{: .example}

Let's make a table again. Again, distance will come from the formula. It is is *not* $115$.

|         | Rate (mph) | Time (hr) | Distance (mi) |
| ------- | :--------: | :-------: | :-----------: |
| Chris   |   $r+10$   |   $1.5$   |  $1.5(r+10)   |
| Parents |    $r$     |    $1$    |      $r$      |

Chris and parents met in the middle, driving from opposite directions. They live $115$ miles apart, so that means *combined* they drove $115$ miles.

$$\begin{align}
1.5(r+10) + r &= 115 \\
1.5r + 15 + r &= 115 \\
2.5r &= 100 \\
r &= 40
\end{align}$$

Chris's parents drove at an average speed of $40$ mph while Chris's trip averaged a speed of $50$.

$\blacksquare$
