## Find the Equation of a Line

So, you have have some information about a line, but need an equation. There are various situations, but we'll boil it down to just two.

### When You Have Slope and Intercept

You have the rate of change of a function, and you know the value when $x=0$. This means you have a slope and a $y$-intercept. Use [slope-intercept form](./4-5-use-the-slope-intercept-form-of-an-equation-of-a-line.md).

### For Every Other Situation

Do you remember the equation for slope?

$$\begin{align}
m = \frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2}
\end{align}$$

I'm going to change it slightly.

$$\begin{align}
m = \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1}
\end{align}$$

And now solve it for $y$.

$$\begin{align}
m &= \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1} \\
m(x - x_1) &= y - y_1 \\
m(x - x_1) + y_1 &= y \\[1em]
y &= m(x - x_1) + y_1 \label{point-slope}
\end{align}$$

That equation at $\ref{point-slope}$ is **point-slope** form, and is a perfectly acceptable version of a linear equation. Like slope-intercept form, it requires only two things to create: a point and a slope.
