## Some advice

- These slides are available through Canvas (or my site)
- Don’t copy the slides
- Write down key ideas *with a pen or pencil*
- At the end, summarize what we covered *with a pen or pencil*

## Intro

- The science of **statistics** deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of **data**
- **Descriptive statistics**: organizing and summarizing data
- **Inferential statistics**: drawing conclusions from “good” data and procedures
- “Good” is essential and should also extend to communicating those conclusions
- Bad statistics can have terrible consequences

## Probability

- Mathematical tool used to study randomness
- Will look at this later in the course
- For now, determining the probability of rolling a 7 on a pair of dice is simple
- Determining the probability of someone being affected by a drug’s side-effect is insanely hard
- Need to rely on statistics and experiments, and those are used to generate probabilities and predictions

## Some Key Terms

- Some of the terms you need to be familiar with
- A population is the group you want to study
- A sample is the group you can actually study, chosen through sampling
- Variables are characteristics or measurements, and can be numerical or categorical
