- Recognize and differentiate between key terms.
- Apply various types of sampling methods to data collection.
- Create and interpret frequency tables.

- [1.3 Homework](https://openstax.org/books/statistics/pages/1-homework#fs-idm8238960) 84–90
- Read the next section in the book

## Answers and Rounding Off

- Don’t sweat reducing fractions
- Avoid rounding decimal values until the very end
- For final answers, round to one more decimal place than was in the original data
- E.g., Original data had three decimal place, round final answers to four decimal places

## Levels of Measurement

### Nominal

- Pure categorical data
- Calculations not possible, only grouping

### Ordinal

- Looks like qualitative data, but can be ordered
- Calculations still not possible
- E.g., excellent, good, satisfactory, and unsatisfactory

### Interval

- Quantitative data with no real starting point
- Zero doesn’t mean zero
- E.g., Fahrenheit/Celsius, SAT scores
- Calculations are possible except for ratio-related ones
- 60° is not twice as hot as 30°

### Ratio

- Quantitative data where zero mean zero
- Most measurements fall in this category
- All calculations are possible
- 4 meters is twice the distance as 2 meters

### Comparison of Levels of Measurement

| Level of Measurement | Put data in categories | Arrange data in order | Subtract data values | Determine whether one data value is a multiple of another |
| -------------------- | :--------------------: | :-------------------: | :------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------: |
| _Nominal_            |        **Yes**         |          No           |          No          |                            No                             |
| _Ordinal_            |        **Yes**         |        **Yes**        |          No          |                            No                             |
| _Interval_           |        **Yes**         |        **Yes**        |       **Yes**        |                            No                             |
| _Ratio_              |        **Yes**         |        **Yes**        |       **Yes**        |                          **Yes**                          |

## Frequency

| DATA VALUE | FREQ. | RELATIVE | CUMUL. |
| :--------: | :---: | -------- | ------ |
|     2      |   3   | 0.15     | 0.15   |
|     3      |   5   | 0.25     | 0.40   |
|     4      |   3   | 0.15     | 0.55   |
|     5      |   6   | 0.30     | 0.85   |
|     6      |   2   | 0.10     | 0.95   |
|     7      |   1   | 0.05     | 1.00   |

- Number of times a data value occurs
- **Relative frequency** is ratio to the total
- **Cumulative relative frequency** is the accumulation of previous ones

|    71.95–73.95    |      7      |       7/100 = 0.07 |              .92 + .07 = 0.99 |
|    73.95–75.95    |      1      |       1/100 = 0.01 |              .99 + .01 = 1.00 |

\* *Data had one decimal place, so ranges have two to prevent overlap*
