## Chapter Objectives

- Display data graphically and interpret the following graphs: stem-and-leaf plots, line graphs, bar graphs, frequency polygons, time series graphs, histograms, box plots, and dot plots
- Recognize, describe, and calculate the measures of location of data with quartiles and percentiles
- Recognize, describe, and calculate the measures of the center of data with mean, median, and mode
- Recognize, describe, and calculate the measures of the spread of data with variance, standard deviation, and range

## One Number to Represent a Set

- An average[^1] is a single number or value that best represents a set of data
- Often also referred to as the center
- Mean: add up all the numbers and divide by the number of numbers
- Median: find the middle number (or 50th percentile)
- Mode: Most frequent value

## $\mu$ vs $\bar{x}$

- $\mu$ (the Greek letter mu) represents the population mean
- $\bar{x}$ represents the sample mean

## Mean of Grouped Frequency Tables

- Use the midpoint of each group as the value
- Frequency is the number of times to count each midpoint.

> ### Mean of a Frequency Table
>
> Sum your midpoints multiplied by their frequency, then divide by the total frequency.
>
> $$\begin{align}
>\mu &= \frac{\sum fm}{\sum f}
> \end{align}$$
