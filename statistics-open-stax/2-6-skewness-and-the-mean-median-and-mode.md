## Chapter Objectives

- Display data graphically and interpret the following graphs: stem-and-leaf plots, line graphs, bar graphs, frequency polygons, time series graphs, histograms, box plots, and dot plots
- Recognize, describe, and calculate the measures of location of data with quartiles and percentiles
- Recognize, describe, and calculate the measures of the center of data with mean, median, and mode
- Recognize, describe, and calculate the measures of the spread of data with variance, standard deviation, and range

## Symmetrical vs Skewed

- In a symmetrical distribution, the left side is a mirror image of the right side
- Mean and the median are the same
- Skewed data is where the bulk of the data is off to the side

> **Figure 2.6.2** A right skewed, or positive skewed, distribution.

- Name is based on where the tail is
- A negative skew has a long tail on the left, or the negative side of the number line
- Positive skew has the tail on the right
- The tail drags the mean to that side, far more than the median
