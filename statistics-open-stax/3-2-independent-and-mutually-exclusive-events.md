## Independent and Dependent Events

- Events that do not influence other events are **independent**
- E.g. rolling a die followed by rolling another one
- Otherwise, they are **dependent** events
- E.g. drawing a card, then another without replacing the first

## Mutually Exclusive Events

- Events are mutually exclusive if they can’t occur at the same time
- Or when $P(A \text{ and } B)=0$
