## Expected Value

Suppose you do some gambling (not advised) and the game is simple: flip a coin and you lose a dollar if the result is tails, but you win a dollar if it's heads. Would you make money over time? Or would you lose money, or maybe even break even?

Hopefully intuition brought you to a "break even" conclusion. Flipping a coin means an equal chance of heads or tails, meaning you're just as likely to lose a dollar than make one. This is a pretty straightforward situation, so let's make it more complicated. What if it's no longer a 50/50 chance and the loss vs win amount is also different?

Now the game is $2 to play and if you win, you're awarded $100,000.
