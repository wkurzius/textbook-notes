A uniform distribution means each event is equally likely to occur. Graphed, this looks like a rectangle since each event is just as high as every other one. We'll look an example of uniform distribution, but I suggest you look through the others in the book as well.

## Smiling Babies

The smiling times of babies follow a uniform distribution between zero and 23 seconds, inclusive. This means that any smiling time from zero to and including 23 seconds is equally likely.

First off, the notation to describe this distribution is $X \sim U(0,23)$

The graph of this distribution is uniform, meaning the height will be the same across the board, and the end result will be a rectangle. The end-points are $0$ and $23$, and the height itself should be $1/23$. A good way to check if you are correct is to see if the total area is $1$.

Next is $f(x)$, which represents the probability of $x$. For uniform distributions, this is straightforward and can be calculated $\frac{1}{b-a}$ where $b$ and $a$ are your endpoints.
