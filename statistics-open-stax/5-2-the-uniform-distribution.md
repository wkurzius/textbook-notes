A uniform distribution means each event is equally likely to occur. Graphed, this looks like a rectangle since each event is just as high as every other one. In this section, we'll look an example of uniform distributions and do some analysis for each. I suggest you look through the others in the book as well.

## Example

> The smiling times of babies follow a uniform distribution between zero and 23 seconds, inclusive. This means that any smiling time from zero to and including 23 seconds is equally likely.
>
> Graph the distribution, find $f(x)$, and then the mean and standard deviation of the distribution.
>
> Finally, determine the probability that a baby will smile for longer than 10 seconds $f(x > 10)$, and also the probability that a baby will smile for _exactly_ 6.7 seconds $f(6.7)$.

Graphing I won't draw here, but since it's uniform the height will be the same across the board, giving you a rectangle. The end-points are $0$ and $23$, and the height itself should be $1/23$. A good way to check if you are correct is to see if the total area is $1$.
