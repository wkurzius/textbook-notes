Now that we have a handle on the normal distributions and _z_-scores, we can move on to probability. If you remember uniform distributions, probability was just area. In uniform distributions, area was straightforward since uniform distributions are just rectangles.

With a normal distribution, determining the area is much more complicated. So complicated in fact, that tables are used to look up the areas.

Open this PDF in a new tab: [Standard Normal Probabilities](../pdfs/standard-normal-probabilities.pdf). You'll notice a picture of a normal distribution with a shaded area and a lot of numbers underneath it. Here's the quick version of how to use this:
