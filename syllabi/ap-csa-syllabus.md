> College Board significantly revised the AP Computer Science A course for the 2025–26 school year. Be aware of this in case you find yourself doing some extra reading on the course. If you are curious what changed, you can see that list [here](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/future-revisions).

## Course Description

AP Computer Science A introduces students to computer science through programming. Fundamental topics in this course include the design of solutions to problems, the use of data structures to organize large sets of data, the development and implementation of algorithms to process data and discover new information, the analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing systems. The course emphasizes object-oriented programming and design using the Java programming language.

## AP Exam

The AP CSA Exam consists of two sections, each 90 minutes long. The first section consists of 42 multiple choice questions and is worth 55% of your exam grade. The second section is worth 45% and has four free response questions where you will write code. The exam date is Friday, May 15 at 12 p.m.

## Units of Study

1. **Using Objects and Methods** Here you'll learn how to use methods to manipulate objects in Java.

2. **Selection and Iteration** This unit focuses on controlling the flow of a program with decision-making structures and loops.

3. **Class Creation** How to encapsulate objects and methods into classes, and the benefits on doing so in the first place.

4. **Data Collections** The final unit is all about how to manage large amounts of data using arrays and similar data structures.
