## Course Description

Algebra revolves around finding the unknown part of an equation. Those equations will involve addition and multiplication at first, but will include exponents later in the year. Along the way, you'll work with graphs and coordinate planes to help visualize solutions to equations.

## Units of Study

1. **Linear Equalities & Inequalities** Covers the basic skills of how to find an unknown quantity

2. **Linear and and Exponential Modeling: Functions and Bivariate Statistics** A deeper look at functions, including new new types and tools to examine them

3. **Quadratic Modeling** The move from linear to quadratic means squared variables, meaning multiple answers might exist

4. **Other Non-Linear Graphs and One-Variable Statistics** The last unit of the course focuses on applying algebra concepts to statistics and data analysis

## Grading

- The official grade book exists on Canvas, with Genesis only having a (possibly unreliable) copy
- There are about three quizzes each marking period
- There is also one exam at the end of each marking period
- All work is due the day of a quiz or exam and late work will receive only partial credit
- Grading is point-based, though assignments are worth roughly 10%, quizzes 40%, and the marking period exam 50% of your marking period grade.
