## Course Description

Anyone who’s anyone has their own website, and this is where you can make yours. This one-semester course focuses on the front-end of web development, or the stuff that everyone sees. This includes structure with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), style with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and will have students begin to build a portfolio of work for future employment.

## Units of Study

1. **HTML, CSS and Forms** Learn how to define the structure of a webpage with HTML and then style it with CSS. You'll apply this by building some online forms.

2. **Flexbox, Typography and Accessibility** Advanced positions of page elements with text styling and learning to design for accessibility.

3. **Intermediate CSS and Responsive Web Design** Various advanced styling topic along with ensuring your pages look good on all devices.

4. **CSS Variables and Grid** Learn how to use variables to manage more complex and styles, along with the grid model, which is another method of positioning page elements.

## Online Curriculum

This course uses the Responsive Web Design curriculum provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/), which serves an online version of the lessons, assignments and resources. If a student completes the full curriculum, freeCodeCamp provides a Responsive Web Design Certificate. We will only cover the first four certification projects, but I encourage those interested to complete the final one on their own.

## Grading

- The official grade book exists on Canvas, with Genesis only having a (possibly unreliable) copy
- Half of your grade comes from exams, and the other half assignments and projects
- The course is self-paced, so completing more work will earn a higher grade
